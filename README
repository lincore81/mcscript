Script Mod 0.03 for Minecraft 1.3.1

DO NOT USE:
Feel free to snoop around, but please remember that this is not an "official release".
The software is pretty much unusable right now. It is unstable, undocumented
and not even compatible with the latest version of Minecraft. You'll need MCP/Eclipse
set up as well as Minecraft 1.3.1 binaries with ModLoader to run it,
so my advice is to not even bother.

IF YOU USE IT ANYWAY:
I'd like some feedback as long as you don't try to tell me what I just tried to tell you.
I can't promise to react to any pull requests or whatever all this git-stuff is called.
Even if I do: please don't expect anything right now.

ABOUT:
This mod adds scripting support to Minecraft. Any JSR-223 compliant script engine
can be used. All JVM-flavors that I ever heard of (all two of them) have JavaScript
1.6 support out of the box, other engines can be added by dumping the jar in the
minecraft bin directory.
